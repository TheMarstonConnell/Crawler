# DungeonMod

A minecraft mod aimed at giving dungeons a more dungeon crawler feel. Completely randomly generated and filled with adventure, these dungeons are perfect for anyone in the later game looking for a thrill.

Rooms are all 9x9 and the entrance faces east. To help add to the game send me a message on twitter @MarstonConnell

TO DO:
* Add more variations of rooms.
* Create more loot for the endings.
* Biome specific entrances,
